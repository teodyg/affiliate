                                    knowledge within the lawful scope allowable under the IRC. In the
                                    case of newly issued laws, and infrequently in the case of more
                                    established ones, the IRS may provide case rulings that interpret,
                                    clarify, restrict, or expand the written law. These rulings
                                    provide a precedence for safe processes. In the absence of such
                                    precedence, we follow the law as best it can be interpreted.
